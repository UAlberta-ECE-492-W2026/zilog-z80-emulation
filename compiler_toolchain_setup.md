### Toolchain Setup

We are using [z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk) for program development on our z80. To install follow direction [here](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation). A modern Ubuntu (at least 24 LTS) is needed if compiling from source. WSL 2 on Windows is also an option. Installing directly on Windows is not recommended.

Our setup does not replicate any other z80 system directly. Fortunatly z88dk provides [signifficant flexibility when it comes to setting up IO devices](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/Classic--Homebrew).
